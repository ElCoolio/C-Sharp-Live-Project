# Python-Live-Project

## Introduction
For two weeks I took part in a project through the Tech Academy to simulate a real devoloper enviroment.  I, and a few other students, work on the same project, adding functions for a website for a local theater.  The experience was eye opening, I learned alot about C#, MVC, CRUD Functionality, and proper version control.  Below you will find snippets of my code and an in depth explaination of the process.


## CRUD Functionality
One of our main objectives for the project was to develop a section of the website to make it possible for someone who was not a 'programmer' to be able to update the site.  This would require using models to simulate the sections of the website that needed to be edited.  I was tasked with managing the uploading and posting of photos of the productions.

### Reserved Story: About page.
My first task was to make the about page for the theater, following the design request from the client.  This required me to do some research and adhere to strict design guidlines, as well as code control, so that if the company's colors changed it would be easy for them to update the site.

### Making the Model
After establishing the about page, I went to work on a seperate part of the website, designing a place where someone could upload photos of the productions and have them displayed.  Makeing the model was easy enough, ASP.net basically does all the heavy lifting.  The hard part came with making it designed to look pleasant.

### Design
The model was originally scaffolded in a standard table.  You can imagine that most users would not find that a friendly way to look at photos.  I set out designing sections for the photos to sit on the page, putting the in bootstrap cards and orginizing the cards so that the photos from the same production sat together on the page.  There was also sime desing needed for the backend user to be able to upload the photos.

### Function
After getting the basic desing done, it was time to add some functions to the page, things like pagination and searching.

### Final Summary
The entire experience was fruitful.  I felt confident that I had a good starting point for my new career path after this sprint course.  I learned alot about desinging a site to the specifications of a user, not to my own preferences.
